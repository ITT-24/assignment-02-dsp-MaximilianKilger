## Overall
Due to WSL restrictions, the software has only been tested on Windows.
I recommend using the scripts run_windows and run_linux to start the programs. They automatically create a venv and install all dependencies.

## Karaoke
Start playback with the SPACE key.
Use keys 1 and 2 to switch between songs.

## Whistle input
Long whistles have a better detection rate than short whistles.
There is a 1.0 second grace period after every input where no new inputs can be detected.
This is done to prevent spurious inputs.
